### Historical CO₂ data with energy, economy, and population indicators (1850-2025)

#### About this file
This file provides a historical view of global CO₂ and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across countries, regions, economic groups, and sectors. It includes detailed information on population, GDP, energy use, and emissions from cement, coal, oil, gas, flaring, and land-use change.

The data is sourced from Our World in Data, a trusted platform for global statistics. Each row represents a country (or group/sector) in a given year, with values for per capita emissions, emissions per GDP, cumulative emissions, and contributions to global climate change.

In addition to CO₂, the dataset contains methane, nitrous oxide, and total GHG emissions, along with energy consumption and trade-related CO₂ indicators. It also reports global shares and estimates of temperature change caused by different greenhouse gases. It consists of 50 columns in total.
